# Specification Quality Checklist: Malware URL Detection API

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-12-30  
**Feature**: [Malware URL Detection API](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified (7 edge cases documented)
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded (URL validation + malware lookup + simple response)
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria (10 FRs with mapped scenarios)
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows (P1: core lookup, P1: validation, P2: performance)
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria (7 measurable SCs)
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Assessment
✅ **PASS**: Specification uses business language without technical stack references. No mention of frameworks, databases, or programming languages - only user-facing requirements.

### Requirement Completeness Assessment
✅ **PASS**: 
- 10 functional requirements clearly stated with MUST/MUST NOT language
- 3 key entities defined without implementation details
- 7 edge cases covering boundary conditions, error scenarios, and concurrency
- 7 success criteria that are measurable and technology-agnostic
- No clarification markers present

### Feature Readiness Assessment
✅ **PASS**:
- **FR-001 to FR-010**: All requirements are testable and clearly mapped to user stories
- **Acceptance Scenarios**: 11 scenarios covering core flow, validation, error handling, and performance
- **Success Criteria**: All measurable with specific metrics (500ms, 100+ concurrent, 95%, 100%, etc.)
- **Scope**: Clearly bounded to URL validation → database lookup → simple response
- **No technology leakage**: Terms like "HTTP", "JSON", "async" appear only where necessary to describe user-facing behavior, not implementation

## Sign-Off

✅ **SPECIFICATION QUALITY APPROVED**

All checklist items pass. This specification is ready for planning phase (`/speckit.plan`).

**Next Steps**:
1. Run `/speckit.plan 001-malware-url-detection` to generate implementation plan
2. Plan will validate against project constitution (comprehensive testing, transparency, incremental changes, scalability, asynchronous design)
3. Once plan is approved, use `/speckit.tasks` to generate implementation tasks organized by user story
